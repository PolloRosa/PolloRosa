ðŸ‘‹ Hola, I'm @PolloRosa from Lima - PerÃº.

I'm slowly returning to my web development dream life.

- ðŸ’ª I'm relearning HTML5, PHP8, JS, CSS3, Bootstrap.

- ðŸŒ± I'm learning Laravel, React, Vue, Tailwind and finally Git+Github.

- âš¡ I'll be learning Cybersecurity for web development, Design Patterns, methodologies and Programming principles.

- âœ¨ I'm allowing myself to learn how to design websites empirically, since I know how to build them but not how to design them.

âœ… Right now: HTML5, PHP, Git+Github.
