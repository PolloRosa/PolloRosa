ðŸ‘‹ Hola, I'm @PolloRosa from Lima - PerÃº.

I'm slowly returning to my web development dream life.

- ðŸ’ª I'm relearning HTML5, CSS3, JS, Bootstrap, PHP8, Java.

- ðŸŒ± I'm learning Git+Github, REACT, Laravel, Vue and Tailwind.

- âš¡ I'll be learning Cybersecurity for web development, Design Patterns, methodologies and Programming principles.

- âœ¨ I'm allowing myself to learn how to design websites empirically, since I know how to build them but not how to design them.

âœ… Right now: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Git+Github on Oracle Next Education program.
